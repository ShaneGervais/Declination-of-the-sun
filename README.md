# Declination-of-the-sun
While the stars in our solar systems stays at a constant declination, our sun doesn't due to the tilt of the earths equatorial axis throughout the year. Resulting in winter solstice having longer nights and the summer solstice having longer days. We've writen a short program to visualize the length of time of our days throughout the year at different locations on earth.

The equation used for the declination of the sun is:
